  # Set 'test-image' to the empty string for all matrix permutations so that the default ('image') will be used
  # to launch an LXC container to test the created packages in. Why explicitly set what is already the default?
  # If this isn't present, later entries in the include set below will overwrite earlier entries that differ
  # only by their 'test-image' value. If however 'test-image' is present in the original matrix by defining it
  # here, then 'included' entries will no longer overwrite each other because they alter a key that is present
  # in the original matrix. This is just how GitHub Actions matrix include rules work.
