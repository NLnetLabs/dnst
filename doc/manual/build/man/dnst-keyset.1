.SH NAME
dnst-keyset \- Manage DNSSEC signing keys for a domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnst keyset\fP \fB\-c <CONF>\fP \fB[OPTIONS]\fP \fB<COMMAND>\fP \fB[ARGS]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBkeyset\fP subcommand manages a set of DNSSEC (\fI\%RFC 9364\fP) signing keys.
This subcommand is meant to be part of a DNSSEC signing solution.
The \fBkeyset\fP subcommand manages signing keys and generates a signed DNSKEY RRset.
A separate zone signer (not part of dnst) is expected to use the zone
signing keys in the key set,
sign the zone and include the DNSKEY RRset (as well as the CDS and CDNSKEY
RRsets).
The keyset subcommand supports keys stored in files and, when the dnst
program is built with the kmip feature flag, keys stored in a
Hardware Security Module (HSM) that can be accessed using the
Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).
.sp
The keyset subcommand operates on one zone at a time.
For each zone, keyset maintains a configuration file that stores configuration parameters for
key generation (which algorithm to use, whether to use a CSK or a
KSK and ZSK pair), parameters for key rolls (whether key rolls are automatic
or not), the lifetimes of keys and signatures, etc.
The keyset subcommand also maintains a state file for each zone.
The state file lists the keys in the key set, the current key roll state,
and has the DNSKEY, CDS, and CDNSKEY RRsets.
key generation (which algorithm to use, whether to use a CSK and a
KSK and a ZSK), parameters for key rolls (whether key rolls are automatic
or not), the lifetimes of keys and signatures, etc.
The keyset subcommand also maintains state file for each zone.
The state file lists the keys in the key set, the current key roll state,
and has the DNSKEY, CDS, and CDNSKEY RRsets.
.sp
In addition to the configuration and state files, keyset maintains files for
keys that are stored on in the filesystem.
Additionally, keyset can optionally maintain a credentials file that
contains user names and passwords for the KMIP connections.
.sp
The keyset subcommand uses the Keyset type from the Rust Domain crate to store
the set of keys together with their properties such as whether a key
should sign the zone, timestamps when keys are created or become stale.
The Keyset data type also implements the basic logic of key rolls.
.sp
The keyset subcommand supports importing existing keys, both standalone
public keys as well as public/private key pairs can be imported.
A standalone public key can only be imported from a file whereas public/private
key pairs can be either files or references to keys stored in an HSM.
Note that the public and private key either need to be both files or both
stored in an HSM.
.SS Signer
.sp
The zone signer is expected to read the state file that is maintained by
keyset to find the current zone signing keys, to find the signed
DNSKEY/CDS/CDNSKEY RRset and to find the KMIP configuration.
.sp
See <ref> for a description of the state file.
.sp
The signer needs to poll the state file for changes.
If the signer is in full control of running keyset, then the state file needs
to be checked for changes after running keyset with commands the can
potientially change the state file (status subcommands, etc. do not change
the state file).
If however keyset can be invoked independently of the signer then the signer needs
to periodically check for changes, for example, at least every hour.
.SS Cron
.sp
The signatures of the DNSKEY, CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets need to updated
periodically.
In addition, key roll automation requires periodic invocation of keyset
to start new key rolls and to make progress on ones that are currently
executing.
.sp
For this purpose, keyset has a cron subcommand.
This subcommand handles any house keeping work that needs to be done.
The cron subcommand can be executed at regular times, for example,
once an hour from the cron(1) utility.
.sp
However, keyset also maintains a field in the state file, called
\fBcron\-next\fP, that specifies when the cron subcommand should be run next.
Running the cron subcommand early is fine, the current time is compared
again the \fBcron\-next\fP field and the subcommand exits early if
\fBcron\-next\fP is in the future.
Running the cron subcommand late may cause signatures to expire.
.SS Create / Init
.sp
The initialisation of a key set for a zone consists of two steps.
First the create subcommand create a configuration file with mostly default
values and a state file without any keys.
The init subcommand finishes the initialisation.
.sp
This two step procedure allows configuration parameters to be set between
the create and the init subcommand, for example, the algorithm to use.
It also allows existing public/private key pairs to be imported.
.sp
The init subcommand checks if any public/private key pairs have been imported.
If so, init checks if both a both roles (KSK and ZSK) are present.
A single CSK combines both rolls.
Absent a CSK, both a KSK and a ZSK need to be present otherwise the init command
fails.
Any imported public keys are ignored by init.
.sp
If no public/private key pairs have been imported then the init subcommand
will start an algorithm roll.
The algorithm roll will create new keys based on the current configuration:
either as files or in an HSM and either a CSK or a pair of KSK and ZSK.
.SS Key Rolls
.sp
The keyset subcommand can perform four different types of key rolls:
KSK rolls, ZSK rolls, CSK rolls and algorithm rolls.
A KSK roll replaces one KSK with a new KSK.
Similarly, a ZSK roll replaces one ZSK with a new ZSK.
A CSK roll also replaces a CSK with a new CSK but the roll also treats a
pair of KSK and ZSK keys as equivalent to a CSK.
So a CSK roll can also roll from KSK plus ZSK to a new CSK or from a CSK
to new a KSK and ZSK pair.
Note that a roll from KSK plus ZSK to a new KSK plus ZSK pair
is also supported.
Finally, an algorithm roll is similar to a CSK roll, but designed in
a specific way to handle the case where the new key or keys have an algorithm
that is different from one used by the current signing keys.
.sp
The KSK and ZSK rolls are completely independent and can run in parallel.
Consistency checks are performed at the start of a key roll.
For example, a KSK key roll cannot start when another KSK is in progress or
when a CSK or algorithm roll is in progress.
A KSK roll cannot start either when the current signing key is a CSK or
when the configuration specifies that the new signing key has to be a CSK.
Finally, KSK rolls are also prevented when the algorithm for new keys is
different from the one used by the current key.
Similar limitations apply to the other roll types. Note however that an
algorithm roll can be started even when it is not needed.
.sp
A key roll consists of six steps: \fBstart\-roll\fP, \fBpropagation1\-complete\fP,
\fBcache\-expired1\fP, \fBpropagation2\-complete\fP, \fBcache\-expired2\fP, and
\fBroll\-done\fP\&.
For each key roll these six steps follow in the same order.
Associated which each step is a (possibly empty) list of actions.
Actions fall in three categories.
The first category consists of actions that require updating the zone or the
parent zone.
The second category consists of actions that require checking if changes
have propagated to all nameservers and require reporting of the
TTLs of the changed RRset as seen at the nameservers.
Finally, the last category requires waiting for changes to propagate to
all nameservers but there is no need to report the TTL.
.sp
Typically, in a list of actions, an action of the first category is paired
with one from the second of third category.
For example, \fBUpdateDnskeyRrset\fP is paired with either
\fBReportDnskeyPropagated\fP or \fBWaitDnskeyPropagated\fP\&.
.sp
A key roll starts with the \fBstart\-roll\fP step, which creates new keys.
The next step, \fBpropagation1\-complete\fP has a TTL argument which is the
maximum of the TTLs of the Report actions.
The \fBcache\-expired1\fP and \fBcache\-expired2\fP have no associated actions.
They simply require waiting for the TTL (in seconds) reported by the
previous \fBpropagation1\-complete\fP or \fBpropagation2\-complete\fP\&.
The \fBpropagation2\-complete\fP step is similar to the \fBpropagation1\-complete\fP step.
Finally, the \fBroll\-done\fP step typically has associated Wait actions.
These actions are cleanup actions and are harmless but confusing if they
are skipped.
.sp
The keyset subcommand provides fine grained control over automation.
Automation is configured separately for each of the four roll types.
For each roll type, there are four booleans called \fBstart\fP, \fBreport\fP,
\fBexpire\fP and \fBdone\fP\&.
.sp
When set, the \fBstart\fP boolean directs the cron subcommand to start a key roll
when a relevant key has expired.
A KSK or a ZSK key roll can start automatically if respectively a KSK or a ZSK
has expired.
A CSK roll can start automatically when a CSK has expired but also when a KSK or
ZSK has expired and the new key will be a CSK.
Finally, an algorithm roll can start automatically when the new algorithm is
different from the one used by the existing keys and any key has expired.
.sp
The \fBreport\fP flags control the automation of the \fBpropagation1\-complete\fP
and \fBpropagation2\-complete\fP steps.
When enabled, the cron subcommand contacts the nameservers of the zone or
(in the case of \fBReportDsPropagated\fP, the nameservers of the parent zone)
to check if changes have propagated to all nameservers.
The check obtains the list of nameservers from the apex of the (parent) zone
and collects all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
For the \fBReportDnskeyPropagated\fP and \fBReportDsPropagated\fP actions, each address is
the queried to see if the DNSKEY RRset or DS RRset match
the KSKs.
The \fBReportRrsigPropagated\fP action is more complex.
First the entire zone is transferred from the primary nameserver listed in the
SOA record.
Then all relevant signatures are checked if they have the expected key tags.
The maximum TTL in the zone is recorded to be reported.
Finally, all addresses of listed nameservers are checked to see if they
have a SOA serial that is greater than or equal to the one that was checked.
.sp
Automation of \fBcache\-expired1\fP and \fBcache\-expired2\fP is enabled by the
\fBexpire\fP boolean.
When enabled, the cron subcommand simply checks if enough time has passed
to invoke \fBcache\-expired1\fP or \fBcache\-expired2\fP\&.
.sp
Finally the \fBdone\fP boolean enables automation of the \fBroll\-done\fP step.
This automation is very similar to the \fBreport\fP automation.
The only difference is that the Wait actions are automated so propagation
is tracked but no TTL is reported.
.sp
Fine grained control of over automation makes it possible to automate
KSK or algorithm without starting them automatically.
Or let a key roll progress automatically except that the \fBcache\-expired\fP
steps must be done manually in order to be able to insert extra manual steps.
.sp
The \fBreport\fP and \fBdone\fP automations require that keyset has network access
to all nameservers of the zone and all nameservers of the parent.
.SS HSM Support (KMIP)
.sp
The keyset subcommand supports keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) through
the KMIP protocol.
The most common way to access keys in HSMs is through the PKCS #11 interface.
The PKCS #11 interface involves loading a shared library into the process
that needs to access the HSM.
This is unattractive for two reasons:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Loading an arbitrary (binary) shared libary negates the memory security
features of an application written in Rust. A mistake in the shared library
could corrupt memory that is used by the application. For this reason it is
attractive to load the shared library into a separate process.
.IP 2. 3
Setting up the run\-time environment of the shared library is often complex.
The library may require specific environment variables or access to specific
files or devices. This complexity impacts every application that wants
to use the shared library.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For these reasons it was decided to write a separate program, called
kmip2kpcs11, that uses the PKCS #11 standard to have access to an HSM and
provides a KMIP server interface. This makes it possible to contain both
the configuration complexity and the possibility of memory corruption in
a single program.
Other programs, such as the keyset subcommand then use the KMIP protocol to
indirectly access the HSM via the kmip2kpcs11 program.
Support for the KMIP protocol also makes it possible to directly connect to
KMIP capable HSMs.
.sp
The keyset subcommand stores two pieces of KMIP configuration.
The first is a list of KMIP servers.
Each KMIP server has a \fBserver ID\fP that is used in key references to specify
in which server the key is stored.
A server also has a DNS name or IP address and a port to connect to the server.
The second piece of configuration is the ID of the server to be used for
creating new keys.
It is possible to specify that no server is to be used for new keys, in that
case new keys will be created by keyset and stored as files.
.sp
Authentication can be done either with a user name and password or with
a client\-side certificate.
The user name and password are KMIP concepts that are mapped by the kmip2pkcs11
server to a PKCS #11 slot or token name and the PIN.
With this approach the kmip2pkcs11 server des not have to store secrets
that provide access to the HSM.
User names and passwords are stored in a separate file to avoid storing
secrets in the keyset configuration or state files.
.sp
Unlike other configuration, the list of KMIP servers is stored in the state
file.
The reason for doing that is that signers also need the same KMIP server list
to be able to sign a zone.
By storing the server list in the state file, a signer has to read only the
state file to be able to use KMIP keys.
.sp
Options that can be configured for a server include not checking the
server\(aqs certificate, specifying the server\(aqs certificate or certificate
authority, various connection parameters such as connect timeout, read
timeout, write timeout and maximum response size.
.sp
When generating new keys, the label of the key can have a user supplied prefix.
This can be used, for example, to show that a key is for
development or testing.
Finally, some HSMs allow longer labels than others.
On HSMs that allow longer labels than the 32 character default, raising the
maximum label length can avoid truncation for longer domain names.
On HSMs that have a limit that is lower than the default, setting the correct
length avoids errors when creating keys.
.SS Importing Keys
.sp
There are three basic ways to import exiting keys: public\-key,
a public/private key pair from files or a public/private key pair in an HSM.
.sp
A public key can only be imported from a file.
When the key is imported the name of the file is converted to a URL and stored in the key set and
the key will be included in the DNSKEY RRset.
This is useful for certain migrations and to manually implement a
multi\-signer DNSSEC signing setup.
Note that automation does not work for this case.
.sp
A public/private key pair can be imported from files.
It is sufficient to give the name of the file that holds the public key if
the filename ends in \fB\&.key\fP and the filename of the private key is the
same except that it ends in \fB\&.private\fP\&.
If this is not the case then the private key filename must be specified
separately.
.sp
In order to use keys stored in a HSM the \fBdnst keyset kmip add\-server\fP
subcommand must first be used to associate the KMIP server connection settings
with a user defined server ID.
.sp
The first server defined becomes the default. If a default KMIP server has
been defined it will be used to generate all future keys, unless the \fBdnst
keyset kmip disable\fP command is issued. If more than one KMIP server is
defined, only one can be the default server at any time. Use the \fBdnst
keyset kmip set\-default\fP command to change which KMIP server will be used
to generate future keys. Note that like all \fBdnst keyset\fP subcommands, the
KMIP subcommands set behaviour for a single zone. Additionally there are
\fBlist\-servers\fP, \fBget\-server\fP, \fBmodify\-server\fP and \fBremove\-server\fP
subcommands for inspecting and altering the configured KMIP server settings.
.sp
Importing a public/private key stored in an HSM requires specifying the KMIP
server ID, the ID of the public key, the ID of the private key, the
DNSSEC algorithm of the key and the flags (typically 256 for a ZSK and
257 for a KSK).
.sp
Normally, keyset assumes ownership of any keys it holds.
This means that when a key is deleted from the key set, the keyset subcommand
will also delete the files that hold the public and private keys or delete the
keys from the HSM that was used to create them.
.sp
For an imported public/private key pair this is considered too dangerous
because another signer may need the keys.
For this reason keys are imported in so\-called \fBdecoupled\fP state.
When a decoupled key is deleted, only the reference to the key is deleted
from the key set, the underlying keys are left untouched.
There is a \fB\-\-coupled\fP option to tell keyset to take ownership of the key.
.SS Migration
.sp
The keyset subcommand has no direct support for migration.
Migration has to be done manually using the import commands.
The semantics of the import commands are described in the previous section.
This section focuses on how the import command can be used to perform a
migration.
.sp
There are three migration strategies: 1) importing the existing signer\(aqs
(private) signing keys, 2) a full multi\-signer migration and 3)
a partial multi\-signer migration.
.SS Importing the existing signer\(aqs signing keys
.sp
Importing the existing signer\(aqs public/private keys pairs is the easiest
migration mechanism.
The basic process is the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Disable automatic key rolls before executing the create command.
For example by setting the KSK, ZSK, and CSK validities to \fBoff\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Import the KSK and ZSK (or CSK) as files or using KMIP between the
create and init commands.
.IP \(bu 2
Check with tools such as ldns\-verify\-zone that the new zone is secure with
the existing DS record at the parent.
.IP \(bu 2
Switch the downstream secondaries that serve the zone to receive the
signed zone from the new signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Perform key rolls for the KSK and ZSK (or the CSK).
.IP \(bu 2
(If wanted) enable automatic key rolls.
.IP \(bu 2
Remove the zone from the old signer.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that after the key roll, the signer has to make sure that it
keeps access to signing keys.
In case of KMIP keys, the old signer can also delete the keys from the HSM.
For this reason it is best to perform key rolls of all keys before removing
the zone from the old signer.
.sp
This document describes key management. Care should be taken that other
parameters, such as the use of NSEC or NSEC3, are
the same (to avoid confusion) and that the SOA serial policy is the same
(to avoid problems with zone transfers).
.SS Full multi\-signer migration
.sp
The basic idea is to execute the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
If the parent supports automatic updating of the DS record using CDS/CDNSKEY
(RFC 8078) then disable the generation of CDS/CDNSKEY records on the
existing signer or disable CDS/CDNSKEY processing for this zone at the parent.
.IP \(bu 2
Issue the create command.
.IP \(bu 2
Disable automatic key rolls.
.IP \(bu 2
(Disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation. Keyset cannot disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation at the moment)
.IP \(bu 2
Import the public key of the existing signer\(aqs ZSK (or CSK) use the
\fBkeyset import public\-key\fP subcommand.
.IP \(bu 2
Issue the init command.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure in the next step to only add a DS record at the parent, not
delete the existing one.
.IP \(bu 2
Complete the initial algorithm roll.
.IP \(bu 2
Verify using tools such as ldns\-verify\-zone that the zone is correctly
signed.
.IP \(bu 2
Import the public key of the new ZSK (or CSK) in the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Verify that all nameservers that serve the zone have the new ZSK in the
DNSKEY RRset of the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Transition the nameservers from the existing signer to the new signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Let caches expire for the DNSKEY RRset of the old signer and the
zone RRSIGs of the old signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Remove the DS record for the old signer from the parent.
.IP \(bu 2
Remove the imported public key.
.IP \(bu 2
(If wanted) enable automatic key rolls and generation of CDS/CDNSKEY
records.
.UNINDENT
.SS Partial multi\-signer migration
.sp
A partial multi\-signer migration is the right approach when the existing
signer cannot import the new signers ZSK.
A requirement is that the new signer can transfer the signed zone from the
existing signer and that the new signer supports so\-called \(dqpass\-through\(dq
mode.
In pass\-through mode a signer leaves signatures for zone records unchanged
but does replace the DNSKEY, CDS and CDNSKEY RRset with the ones from
this subcommand.
.sp
The basic idea is to execute the following steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Disable (automatic) key rolls on the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
If the parent supports automatic updating of the DS record using CDS/CDNSKEY
(RFC 8078) then disable the generation of CDS/CDNSKEY records in the
existing signer or disable CDS/CDNSKEY processing for this zone at the parent.
.IP \(bu 2
Issue the create command.
.IP \(bu 2
Disable automatic key rolls.
.IP \(bu 2
(Disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation. Keyset cannot disable CDS/CDNSKEY generation at the moment)
.IP \(bu 2
Import the public key of the existing signer\(aqs ZSK (or CSK).
.IP \(bu 2
Issue the init command.
.IP \(bu 2
Switch the new signer to pass\-through mode. The signer has to transfer the
signed zone from the existing signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure in the next step to only add a DS record at the parent, not
the delete the existing one.
.IP \(bu 2
Complete the initial algorithm roll.
.IP \(bu 2
Verify using tools such as ldns\-verify\-zone that the zone is correctly
signed.
.IP \(bu 2
Transition the nameservers from the existing signer to the new signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Let caches expire for the DNSKEY RRset of the old signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Remove the DS record for the old signer from the parent.
.IP \(bu 2
Switch off pass\-through mode.
.IP \(bu 2
Let caches expire for the zone RRSIGs of the old signer.
.IP \(bu 2
Remove the imported public key.
.IP \(bu 2
(If wanted) enable automatic key rolls and generation of CDS/CDNSKEY
records.

.IP \(bu 2
ksk, zsk, csk, and algorithm
.sp
The ksk, zsk, csk, and algorithm commands perform manual key roll steps.
These commands have the following subcommands:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
start\-roll
.sp
Start a key roll of the type specified by the command.
.IP \(bu 2
propagation1\-complete <TTL>
.sp
Inform keyset that the changed RRsets and signatures have propagated.
Report the maximum TTL of the report actions.
.IP \(bu 2
cache\-expired1
.sp
Inform keyset that enough time has passed that caches should have expired.
Note that this command will fail if invoked too early.
.IP \(bu 2
propagation2\-complete <TTL>
.sp
This command is similar to propagation1\-complete.
.IP \(bu 2
cache\-expired2
.sp
This command is similar to cache\-expired1.
.IP \(bu 2
roll\-done
.sp
Inform keyset that the changed RRsets and signatures have propagated
and that any wait actions have been executed successfully.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
import
.sp
The import command can either import a public key in a file or a
public/private key pair in either files or as KMIP references.
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
public\-key <PATH>
.sp
A reference to a public key in <PATH> is added to the keyset.
Imported public keys are added to the DNSKEY RRset.
.IP \(bu 2
ksk, zsk, csk
.sp
A key pair is imported as a KSK, ZSK, or CSK.
When a key is imported, there is the question what to do when the
imported key is later deleted.
By default, keyset imports keys in \fBdecoupled\fP state.
When a decoupled key is later removed, only the reference is deleted from
the key set.
The file that contains the key is not deleted and the key is not deleted
from an HSM.
Passing the option \fB\-\-coupled\fP when importing a key, directs keyset to
take ownership of the key.
.sp
The key pair can be imported in two ways:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
file <PATH>
.sp
The <PATH> argument refers to the public key. The filename of the
private key is derived from the public key unless the \fB\-\-private\-key\fP
option is used to specify the filename that holds the private key.
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \-\-coupled
Take ownership of the imported keys.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \-\-private\-key <PATH>
Explicitly pass the name of the file that holds the private key.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
kmip <SERVER> <PUBLIC_ID> <PRIVATE_ID> <ALGORITHM> <FLAGS>
.sp
The <SERVER> argument specifies one of the KMIP servers that has been
configured using the \fBkmip add\-server\fP command.
The <PUBLIC_ID> and <PRIVATE_ID> arguments are the KMIP identifiers of
the public key and the private key respectively.
The DNSSEC algorithm is specified using the <ALGORITHM> argument and
finally the <FLAGS> argument (usually 256 or 257) is the value of
the flags field in the DNSKEY record for the public key.
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \-\-coupled
Take ownership of the imported keys.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
remove\-key <KEY>
.sp
Remove a key or key pair from the key set.
The <KEY> argument is the URL of the public key.
If the key is \fBcoupled\fP then the files that hold the keys are also removed
or, in case of KMIP keys, the keys are removed from the HSM.
Normally, keys are only removed when they are stale.

When set to true, the corresponding step or steps of the key roll specified
by the command are executed automatically.
.sp
For example, \fBauto\-csk true false true false\fP means that
CSK rolls will start automatically, that the propagation1\-complete,
propagation2\-complete, and roll\-done need to be executed manually.
The cache\-expired1 and cache\-expired2 steps are executed automatically.

specified duration.
For the syntax of <DURATION> see \fBdnskey\-lifetime\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
dnskey\-inception\-offset <DURATION>, cds\-inception\-offset <DURATION>
.sp
When generating signatures for the DNSKEY RRset (dnskey\-inception\-offset)
or the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets (cds\-inception\-offset), set the inception
timestamp this amount in the past to compensate for clocks that are a
bit off or in the wrong time zone.
For the syntax of <DURATION> see \fBdnskey\-lifetime\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
ksk\-validity <DURATION> | \fBoff\fP, zsk\-validity <DURATION> | \fBoff\fP, csk\-validity <DURATION> | \fBoff\fP
.sp
Set how long a KSK, ZSK, or CSK is considered valid.
The special value \fBoff\fP means that no limit has been set.
For the syntax of <DURATION> see \fBdnskey\-lifetime\fP\&.
.sp
When a key is no longer considered valid and automatic starting of the
appropriate key roll has been enabled then a key roll will start at the
next invocation of the cron command.
.sp
The status command shows which keys are no longer valid or when their
validity will end.
.IP \(bu 2
update\-ds\-command
